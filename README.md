# BusMall

BusMall is a startup seeking to build a streamlined catalog to provide items to people on buses. Being a startup overhead is limited in finances for print materials and distribution. We have been tasked to create an app that will be used in focus groups to establish the most popular products to be displayed in a catalog. 

The user wants three side by side images of products that the focus gourp can choose from. Once an item is selected, move to another set of photos. After 25 selections and 25 only, display what the consumer chose. Also display the  percentage of which items were clicked.

The chart has been updated and is working properly and data is being stored.
The products are being compare with no repeat pairs. 
There is CSS styling on the page.
